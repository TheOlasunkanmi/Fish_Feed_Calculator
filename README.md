Hello Users.

This is my first personal project using C programming.

I decided to make this my first project because as a student of aquaculture, nothing else seemed perfect. I have always wanted to use my knowledge of software development to improve aquaculture.

To compound fish feeds, ingredients used are based on the fish nutritional requirements. The most important of these requirements is protein content which differentiates feed component based on AGE OF FISH. Subsequently, young fish require more protein content compared to adult fish.


The Fish Feed Calculator is a program that can be used to calculate the amount of each of these components based on 3 different protein requirements and the total amount of feed to be produced.
